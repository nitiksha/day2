g. Can you overload a method with the same return type? Explain your
answer with proper logic.

Ans)Yes but the parameter list should b different,atleast the order of parameter should b reversed.
example
Case1:
       float mymethod(int a, float b)
       float mymethod(float var1, int var2)

Result: Runs Perfectly fine. Valid case for overloading. 
Sequence of the data types are different, first method is
having (int, float) and second is having (float, int).

Case 2:

int mymethod(int a, int b)
int mymethod(int num)  

Result: Runs Perfectly fine. Valid case for overloading. Here number of arguments are different.

Case 4:

float mymethod(int a, float b)
float mymethod(float var1, int var2)
Result: Runs Perfectly fine. Valid case for overloading. 
Sequence of the data types are different, first method is having (int, float) and second is having (float, int).
